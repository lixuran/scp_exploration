"There was Lian, who used to be an interior decorator—she designed the whole layout. Put chairs around fake fireplaces, created little “apartments” for each of us. We had Ravi, a software guy, who reprogrammed one of the info kiosks to play music. Jazz, mostly. At night we’d sit around eating meatballs and listening to Coltrane echo through the aisles. And Miri—our chef She could make a meal from nothing. Canned lingonberry jam, frozen fish sticks, even managed coffee from some hidden stash. She said, “If I die in IKEA, I’ll die with dignity—and breakfast.We had 14 people. 14 stories. 14 hopes.",
"The Staff didn’t come often. They walked past. Stared sometimes. But Pine Nest was peaceful for weeks. We thought maybe—just maybe—we’d done it right. Some even said this place wasn’t a curse. That maybe we were chosen.And we started to believe it.",
"Then it happended. That night, the lights didn't flicker like usual. They shattered. Overhead bulbs bursting like popcorn in the sky. We ran to the walls.We saw the first Staff entity leap the barrier. Leap. It moved wrong. Like a broken marionette made of wet towels and hatred. It smashed through chairs, tore the rug barricades like tissue. We screamed.Miri tried to distract one so the kids could run. She didn’t make it. Ravi grabbed a lamp and tried to fight. We found half the lamp the next day. Not him. Lian? She locked herself in the fake “bedroom” setup. The kind with the fake window and plastic curtains. The door wasn’t even real. They dragged the whole set away. She screamed the whole time. I don’t think they kill you fast.",
